## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- In this challenge I used react props and successfully separate components for repetitive works. 
- I added more custom theme configrations on ``` tailwind.config.js ```

> [!NOTE]
> Please consider I'm not going to generalize the components much more. Because, it added more complexity over usage of components.

### Continued development

I will explore the more optimal ways to fine tune the code with React and Tailwind.
